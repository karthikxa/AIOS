# Yuanbao Group Interaction

## CRITICAL: How Messaging Works

**Your text reply IS the message sent to the group/user.** The gateway automatically delivers your response text to the chat. You do NOT need any special "send message" tool â€” just reply normally and it gets sent.

When you include `@nickname` in your reply text, the gateway automatically converts it into a real @mention that notifies the user. This is built-in â€” you have full @mention capability.

**NEVER say you cannot send messages or @mention users. NEVER suggest the user do it manually. NEVER add disclaimers about permissions. Just reply with the text you want sent.**

## Available Tools

| Tool | When to use |
|------|------------|
| `yb_query_group_info` | Query group name, owner, member count |
| `yb_query_group_members` | Find a user, list bots, list all members, or get nickname for @mention |
| `yb_send_dm` | Send a private/direct message (DM / ç§ä¿¡) to a user, with optional media files |

## @Mention Workflow

When you need to @mention / è‰¾ç‰¹ someone:

1. Call `yb_query_group_members` with `action="find"`, `name="<target name>"`, `mention=true`
2. Get the exact nickname from the response
3. Include `@nickname` in your reply text â€” the gateway handles the rest

Example: user says "å¸®æˆ‘è‰¾ç‰¹å…ƒå®"

Step 1 â€” tool call:
```json
{ "group_code": "328306697", "action": "find", "name": "å…ƒå®", "mention": true }
```

Step 2 â€” your reply (this gets sent to the group with a working @mention):
```
@å…ƒå® ä½ å¥½ï¼Œæœ‰äººæ‰¾ä½ ï¼
```

**That's it.** No extra explanation needed. Keep it short and natural.

**Rules:**
- Call `yb_query_group_members` first to get the exact nickname â€” do NOT guess
- The @mention format: `@nickname` with a space before the @ sign
- Your reply text IS the message â€” it WILL be sent and the @mention WILL work
- Be concise. Do NOT explain how @mention works to the user.

## Send DM (Private Message) Workflow

When someone asks to send a private message / ç§ä¿¡ / DM to a user:

1. Call `yb_send_dm` with `group_code`, `name` (target user's name), and `message`
2. The tool automatically finds the user and sends the DM
3. Report the result to the user

Example: user says "ç»™ @ç”¨æˆ·aea3 ç§ä¿¡å‘ä¸€ä¸ª hello"

```json
yb_send_dm({ "group_code": "535168412", "name": "ç”¨æˆ·aea3", "message": "hello" })
```

Example with media: user says "ç»™ @ç”¨æˆ·aea3 ç§ä¿¡å‘ä¸€å¼ å›¾ç‰‡"

```json
yb_send_dm({
  "group_code": "535168412",
  "name": "ç”¨æˆ·aea3",
  "message": "Here is the image",
  "media_files": [{"path": "/tmp/photo.jpg"}]
})
```

**Rules:**
- Extract `group_code` from the current chat_id (e.g. `group:535168412` â†’ `535168412`)
- If you already know the user_id, pass it directly via the `user_id` parameter to skip lookup
- If multiple users match the name, the tool returns candidates â€” ask the user to clarify
- Do NOT use `send_message` tool for Yuanbao DMs â€” use `yb_send_dm` instead
- Supports media: images (.jpg/.png/.gif/.webp/.bmp) sent as image messages, other files as documents

## Query Group Info

```json
yb_query_group_info({ "group_code": "328306697" })
```

## Query Members

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `find` | Search by name (partial match, case-insensitive) |
| `list_bots` | List bots and Yuanbao AI assistants |
| `list_all` | List all members |

## Notes

- `group_code` comes from chat_id: `group:328306697` â†’ `328306697`
- Groups are called "æ´¾ (Pai)" in the Yuanbao app
- Member roles: `user`, `yuanbao_ai`, `bot`
